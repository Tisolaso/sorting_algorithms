## Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation Analysics

# Welcome to Sorting World using C language

This project aims to demonstrate various classic sorting techniques and their corresponding Big O notations. Understanding sorting algorithms and their efficiency is essential for any computer scientist or developer.

# The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort

# Format used for Quiz and Task questions:
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
O(n^2)
O(log(n))
O(nlog(n))
O(n+k)

Happy Sorting :)
